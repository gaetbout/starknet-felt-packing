Uint128, Uint256, Uint1024. Ok I get it... We  can do big integers.  
But why not going smaller, what about uint8, uint16, ...  

The idea is to store multiple smaller numbers into one felt. A felt is encoded on 252 bits so you'd think that we can use all the bits? Actually we can't because the biggest felt is a prime number, therefore the effective number of bits we can use is 251. And since 251 is a prime number, there will alway be some bit losses... For example if we want to encode numbers going up to 256 (0-255) we'll use 8 bits. Then we have to use an euclidian division to know how much how the felt we can use:  
251 // 8 = quotient=31, remainder=3.  
This means that we'll be able to encode 31 numbers with a leftover of 3 bits that won't be useable.  

To demonstrate this is working I tried to make a simple proof of concept based on the [reddit game: r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/).  
You can find it [here on testnet](https://odd-art-7900.on.fleek.co/), it has been deployed on IPFS through fleek.  
Since I'm no front-end developer I tried my best, but there are few stuff that could be enhanced or reworked (if you want to get involved, don't hesitate to open a PR, or ping me and I'll open some issues).  
It follow the same simple rule which is that a user can put a pixel every 5 minutes. For memory reason, I had to limit the colors to be encoded to 4 bits (which provides 16 colors).  
Therefore it allows to encode:
251 // 4 = quotient=62, remainder=3
62 colors per felt!  
One the current board 120*56 it which makes 6720 coordinates, it is all encoded on 109 felts.

I should be releasing another library to support uint10, uint16, any smaller uint basically!
